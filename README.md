## Tile Set 1
Tile Set 1 was successfully generated using QMetaTiles from a Mapbox Light basemap.
The output follows the standard {z}/{x}/{y}.png tile structure across zoom levels 11–15.

## Tile Set 2
I attempted to generate Tile Set 2 using QTiles for a custom points layer.
Despite correct CRS settings (EPSG:3857), valid layer extents, and multiple parameter
configurations, QTiles completed without errors but did not write output tiles.
I contacted the TA prior to the deadline and included screenshots documenting the issue.
